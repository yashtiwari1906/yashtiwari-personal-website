# Some history

- When I was in school I never thought that I'll be an Engineer one day but after getting into Mathematics & Science I've fallen in love with those that's why I love BBT most.
- After getting into the college I got introduced to the world of programming, I was not from a CSE branch so I tried to explore for while but eventually I got into Data Sciecne and AI.
- After studying Machine Learning & Deepl Learning I was lucky enough to get an Intern in the field at HyperVerge and from that all the story started of my professional journey.
- After HyperVerge I had worked with OLA, Innovaccer and Swift It feels like there is a lot in this world of technology and I want to do it all at once Ha Ha I know it's not possible but anyway I'm really passionate about Research and creating AI products.

# Fun facts

- In my college I use to organize a fest named as Spardha which is still very close to my heart.
